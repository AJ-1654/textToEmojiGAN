Project Title: **Generating Emojis from text using Generative Adversarial Network**

Generative Adversarial Networks are generative models. It consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator.
Discriminator is a classifier that tries to distinguish between the real data and the fake data that is generated by the generator.
Generator is a neural network which initially takes a noise as input and produces fake samples to fool the discriminator.
As the training progresses the generator produces samples that are very close to the real samples.

Features are extracted from the text and an emoji is generated to the corresponding features.
For example “A smiling face with black sunglasses” will generate ![GAN Demo](https://github.com/anish-jangra/textToEmojiGAN/blob/master/gandemo.png).

EmojiOne Data set is used for training.
TensorFlow is used for implementing the GAN in python.
